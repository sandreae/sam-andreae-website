          <h1>silence blossoms</h1>
          For this band I've spent much time working with poetry and lyrics to
          write songs that the band can use as a starting point for
          improvisations. Sometimes we work with a particular idea for a song (a
          texture, combination of instruments or rhythmic pattern) and sometimes
          we leave the whole process very open, letting the compositions merge
          into each other. The band is Hanna Olivegren (voice) and Gus Loxbo
          (bass, guitar, saw, voice) and myself (saxophone, clarinet,
          electronics, keyboard, voice). <br />
          We play mostly in Sweden but sometimes in Norway and Denmark too.
          We've been selling lo-fi recordings at gigs for a while now, but we
          are planning a combined cassette tape and digital release of live
          material later in 2012.
          <br />
          This is one of the poems we've used, and artwork from Angela Guyton,
          who is our expressive translator in all things visual-art related.<br /><br /><br />

          POEM<br />
          <i
            >I heard of a man<br />
            who says words so beautifully<br />
            that if he only speaks their name<br />
            women give themselves to him<br />

            If I am dumb beside your body<br />
            while silence blossoms like tumors on our lips<br />
            it is because I hear a man climb stairs<br />
            and clear his throat outside our door</i
          ><br />
