This CD is available now on the [Sound Anatomy](http://soundanatomy.com/) label. I joined the core Lightning Ensemble trio of [Richard Scott](href="http://richard-scott.net/), Philip Marks and [David Birchall](https://davidmbirchall.com/) on several tracks. Recorded by [Sam Weaver](http://www.cuspeditions.co.uk/) on the 5th floor of [Islington Mill](http://www.islingtonmill.com/), Salford. What the trio have worked on together over many years is somehting really special, a shared improvising method that I very much enjoyed being a part of.
