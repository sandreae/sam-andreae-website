I was lucky to be able to spend new Year in Japan this year, mostly in and around Tokyo. As part of the trip I assisted in installing Mio Ebisu's solo exhibition. My main job was building a large cup of tea replica. I constructed a frame out of timber and then wrapped multiple layers of thin plywood around the outside.
