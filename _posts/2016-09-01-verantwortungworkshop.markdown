One of the two workshops I ran at [VERANTWORTUNG3000](http://www.verantwortung3000.de/) festival at an old farm building outside of Berlin. this session was really special, somehow very ritualistic, we listened to a full recording once in the bar afterwards and then due to accidental deletion it was lost forever. This video is all that's left, the audio from it was later released :-)
