This was a one month residency at [The Penthouse](http://thepenthousenq.com/) where [David Birchall](https://davidmbirchall.com/) and myself made lots of fun experiments with transducers all over the building, a 60m long piano wire, radio microphones and beer can speakers. [Mio Ebisu](http://www.mioebisu.com/) collaborated with us by painting 120 20cmx30cm artworks for the long corridor space.
