LIVE IN BEPPU is released into the world. I'm really proud of this release, it was the result of a three day residency with many fantastic people in Beppu, this is a recording of the concert we performed as a trio at the end of it. Thanks to Hinago-san at ReNTReC for hosting the gig and recording it, everybody at Beppu Project/Platform 05, Bodies at Play friends and colleagues: Arthorymen, Mio, Rina, Ono-kun (also for taking the cover photograph), Kazusa-san, Hino-san, Chigusa-chan and Tayuu-san and Kotobuki Onsen and Onsenmeister where we took the cover image.
