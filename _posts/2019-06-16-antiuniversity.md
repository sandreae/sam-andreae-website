*The Antiuniversity is an ongoing programme of self organised radical learning and mutual education events. It is a collaborative experiment to challenge academic and class hierarchy - in, outside and against existing institutional structures.*

This year I joined the organising team for Antiuniversity Now. I also helped run a childcare event where we made anti-fascist milkshakes ;-p there were too many good events to list them here, check the [archived programme](http://programme.antiuniversity.org/) for full details.
