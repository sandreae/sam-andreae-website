A graphic composition for large improvising ensemble exploring small units of repeated material and displaced interactions. With this piece I was interested in putting up barriers to challenge the usual formal patterns which occur when larger ensembles improvise together. The very natural desire to mimic and find mutual consensus is challenged with arbitrary mental processes.
