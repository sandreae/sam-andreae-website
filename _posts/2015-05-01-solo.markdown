Very happy to have my debut solo record released on Manchester label [Tombed Visions](https://tombedvisionsrecords.bandcamp.com/). It was recorded expertly in my basement in Macclesfield by Jon Tippler. Here are a few words people have said about it:

**"Solo" reviewed by Daniel Spicer, The Wire, 2015**

>“Andreae delves into an impressive vocabulary of skilfully controlled overtones, rapid keypad flutters and fragile harmonics, glistening like filaments held up to the light.” 

**["Solo" reviewed by Paul Margee at Louder Than Noise](http://louderthanwar.com/sam-andreae-solo-album-review/), June 2015**

>*Sam Andreae plots a new course for the saxophone in this album of solo improvisations*
