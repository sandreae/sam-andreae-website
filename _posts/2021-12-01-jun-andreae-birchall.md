>*"Plugged into our impossible online room, triangulated between Beijing, London & Manchester via autonomous noise unit, we clicked here and there to tune into each other and quickly imagined an ecstatic Morbid Angel covers band, riding waves of device distortion and 5000 miles of time delay. I was on an aural noise high for hours after the session just like that first time seeing LOUD bands in the Princess Charlotte in Leicester as a kid, inaudible, cloth eared to the teachers at school the next day. A private underwater sound joy."*
