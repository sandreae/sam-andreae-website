  <li>Find a location in the performance / rehearsal space where you want to set-up, you can relocate at any time and it is ok to setup in small sub-groups or completely spread out.</li>

  <li>Observe your surroundings and any sound-gestures that draw your attention. Observe the properties of the sound, and also to how itâ€™s appearance affects the space and any relationships within it. Where is your focus now drawn to? How does this change? Is the space in a balanced or unbalanced state? Is there a center? Where does power reside? Have common boundaries been established?</li>
  <li>Mark your observations on the floor-plan provided.</li>
  <li>Imagine a sound-gesture you could add to the space. How might it re-focus attention? How might it interfere with existing interactions? How might boundaries and relationships shift?</li>
  <li>Mark your sound-gesture on the floor plan.</li>
  <li>Count down from an arbitrary number, then perform your sound-gesture.</li>
  <li>When finished, repeat steps 1 to 5. This process could happen suddenly with spontaneity or gradually in a considered way. In all cases, try to feel you have enacted each step.</li>
  <li>You can freely make the decision to finish performing at any point. When you decide this, using your crepe paper, draw a line through the space and then observe the remainder of the concert. When each member of the ensemble has done this, the piece is finished.</li>
