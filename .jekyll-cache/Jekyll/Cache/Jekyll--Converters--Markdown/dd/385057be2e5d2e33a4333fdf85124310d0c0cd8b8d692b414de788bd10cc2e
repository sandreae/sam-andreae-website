<blockquote>
  <p><em>The sympathetic support of each instrument and player is super-palpable as each voice is selfless enough to bring out the best in each other.  Be that a slow dripping, almost Sonic Youth-style, electric gamelan or a razor-sharp ladder of tones, each essential to the overall sculpture.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Top-notch weirdo jams from the north of Englandâ€¦..Hair In The Chimney brings an underground sensibility to free improvisation, with the musicians using unconventional techniques to defamiliarise their instruments.</em></p>
