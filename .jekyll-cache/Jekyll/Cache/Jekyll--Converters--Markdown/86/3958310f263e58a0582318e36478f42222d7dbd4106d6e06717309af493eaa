I"~<p>Very happy to have my debut solo record released on Manchester label <a href="https://tombedvisionsrecords.bandcamp.com/">Tombed Visions</a>. It was recorded expertly in my basement in Macclesfield by Jon Tippler. Here are a few words people have said about it:</p>

<p><strong>“Solo” reviewed by Daniel Spicer, The Wire, 2015</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Andreae delves into an impressive vocabulary of skilfully controlled overtones, rapid keypad flutters and fragile harmonics, glistening like filaments held up to the light.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><a href="http://louderthanwar.com/sam-andreae-solo-album-review/">“Solo” reviewed by Paul Margee at Louder Than Noise</a>, June 2015</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Sam Andreae plots a new course for the saxophone in this album of solo improvisations</em></p>
