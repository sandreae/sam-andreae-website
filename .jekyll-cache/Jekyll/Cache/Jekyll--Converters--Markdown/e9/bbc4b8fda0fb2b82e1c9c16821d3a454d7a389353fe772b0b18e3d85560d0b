I"·<p><em>for large ensemble</em></p>

<p>Performance Notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>circles represent a small looped phrase, rhythm or gesture. Interpret the ‚Äúevents‚Äù on each loop freely.</li>
  <li>when performing a loop, you should attempt to repeat it accurately.</li>
  <li>once a loop has been started you should play constantly.</li>
  <li>you can move to another loop by following the connecting lines.</li>
  <li>in order to move, you should give yourself a ‚Äúcountdown‚Äù of seconds or loops (for example ‚Äúmove onto next loop after 20 seconds).</li>
  <li>proceed with your count and then move immediately to the new loop and begin playing.</li>
  <li>when moving to a new loop you can choose to ‚Äúmute‚Äù yourself. This would mean that you are still located on a specific loop, but you are not playing. To move onto another loop you would initiate a countdown.</li>
  <li>the circles with a large black circle inside are ‚Äúfree-play‚Äù sections. You don‚Äôt need to loop anything here, you can play freely.</li>
</ul>
