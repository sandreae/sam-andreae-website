  <p>‚Äúwhat Sam Andreae does is liminal music, he shows you the clicks, the noises, the breaths, the rattle and hum that producers normally want to take off the record‚Äù</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The sympathetic support of each instrument and player is super-palpable as each voice is selfless enough to bring out the best in each other.  Be that a slow dripping, almost Sonic Youth-style, electric gamelan or a razor-sharp ladder of tones, each essential to the overall sculpture.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A saxophonist by trade, Sam Andreae has constructed a zany record of micro-music and absurdist compositions. All of the tracks here involve human voices, but rather than singing or speech we get garbled yelps or what sound like mouse-choirs. Accordions wheeze away before being discarded for solos on empty bottles or beats tapped out on table-tops. A tough nut to crack at first, the record soon charms you with its hair-brained schemes.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Sam Andreae, the Macclesfield-based saxophonist presents Solo, presents a 13-track exploiration of the sonic possibilities at the extreme end of the jazz spectrum. Each track focuses on a unique and distinctive set of parameters described by track titles. Compiled using an assortment of different microphone placements, a no input mixer, an assortment of live digital processing software and the expertise of recording engineer Jon Tipler and technician Rodrigo Constanzo Overall, this truly original release highlights just how masterful Andreae‚Äôs knowledge of the saxophone is.</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.stereoboard.com/content/view/191435/9">Stereoboard review of ‚ÄúSolo‚Äù</a>, Ben Bland, 2015</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Sam Andreae has established himself as a notable young voice in Britain‚Äôs vibrant avant-garde jazz scene in recent times, particularly through his work with Andrew Cheetham and David Birchall. Here, however, the Macclesfield-based saxophonist provides the first evidence of his enormous potential as a solo artist. Don‚Äôt expect the squalling sax sound of free jazz legend, for ‚ÄòSolo‚Äô is an altogether different exploration of the tenor saxophone‚Äôs physical capabilities than one might expect, one largely utilising acoustics, breath and feedback. The result is astonishing, and near impossible to analyse thanks to its distinctiveness of voice. ‚ÄòSolo‚Äô is essential listening for anyone interested in the wild sonic possibilities at the extreme end of the jazz spectrum.</em></p>
