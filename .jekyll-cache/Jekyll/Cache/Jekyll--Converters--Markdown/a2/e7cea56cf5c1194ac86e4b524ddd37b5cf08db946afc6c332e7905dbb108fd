I"¼<p><a href="http://klangkeller.net">KLANGKELLER</a> is a night I founded in Berlin in 2016, the first season of 10 events happened between April and December of that year. We are lucky to be located at <a href="http://www.k77.org/">K77</a> which is a cooperative house with itâ€™s history in the artist squats of the 80s &amp; 90s. A team of us manage the events, and each night has 3 slots which performers can freely sign up for.
